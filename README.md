# Bowling Test

## Rules of bowling

### 🎳 Bowling Scoring Overview

A game of bowling consists of 10 frames. In each frame, you have up to two chances to knock down all 10 pins. The goal is to score as many points as possible by knocking down pins and earning bonuses for strikes and spares.

### 🔢 Scoring Basics

Each pin knocked down = 1 point
Your score for each frame includes:
The total number of pins knocked down in that frame.
Any bonuses for strikes or spares (see below).

### ✅ Strike (X)

A strike happens when you knock down all 10 pins on the first roll of a frame.

Score = 10 + the pins knocked down in your next two rolls
Example:

Frame 1: Strike (X) → Next two rolls = 4, 5 → Frame 1 score = 10 + 4 + 5 = 19

### ➕ Spare (/)

A spare happens when you knock down all 10 pins in two rolls of a frame.
Score = 10 + the pins knocked down on your next roll
Example:

Frame 1: 7, 3 (spare) → Next roll = 4 → Frame 1 score = 10 + 4 = 14

### 🚨 Open Frame

An open frame is when you don't knock down all 10 pins in two rolls.
Score = Total pins knocked down in that frame.
Example:

Frame 1: 4, 5 → Score = 4 + 5 = 9

### 🔥 10th Frame Rule

In the 10th frame, if you get a strike or a spare, you earn extra rolls:
Strike = 2 extra rolls
Spare = 1 extra roll
Your 10th frame score includes these extra rolls.
Example:

10th Frame: X, X, 5 → Score = 10 + 10 + 5 = 25

### 🏆 Perfect Game

A perfect game is 12 consecutive strikes (10 frames + 2 bonus rolls).
Maximum score = 300
